This project presents a Java implementation of the SHA-3 cryptographic hash function inspired by designs of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
Implemented by Arsh Singh Saran and Hassan Ali.

Key Features:
SHA-3 Algorithm Implementation: Provides a complete implementation of the SHA-3 algorithm, including the Keccak-f permutation, initialization, update, and finalization routines.
Support for SHAKE Variants: Includes support for SHAKE128 and SHAKE256, variants of SHA-3 optimized for generating variable-length output, enhancing versatility for cryptographic applications.
